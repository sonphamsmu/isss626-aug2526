# **1 Overview**

![](images/clipboard-2863953254.png)

~[*Inside a Hawker Center (via TripAdvisor)*]{.smallcaps}~

The Food & Beverage (F&B) and Hospitality sector is a vital pillar of Singapore’s economy, contributing significantly to both employment and tourism-driven revenue. In 2024, international visitor arrivals reached about **16.5 million**, and tourism receipts rose to **S\$29,781 million** (or \~SGD 29.8 billion), a strong recovery to pre-pandemic levels. Among the components of tourism spend, expenditure on Food & Beverage increased by 6% year-on-year in January - September 2024. The F&B services sector also plays a major role domestically: for example, in July 2025, its sales reached **S\$1.0 billion**, with fast food outlets and food caterers showing notable growth, and approximately a quarter of F&B sales happening online.

Beyond raw numbers, the sector deeply shapes everyday life—socializing, culture, lifestyle—through restaurants, hawker centers, cafés, bars, catering, etc. It’s also a key part of the hospitality value chain: hotels not only provide lodging but often generate substantial revenue from associated F&B (restaurants, banquets). The dynamic interplay between F&B manufacturers, drink producers, and service-based outlets influences urban planning (where clusters of eating and dining pop up), business location decisions, land-use, and labour markets.

## **2.2 The Data**

### 2.2.1 Business Categories Overview

Using the **Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) 2020**, three business categories were selected for analysis: **Food and Beverage Service Activities (Division 56), Manufacture of Other Food Products (Group 107), and Manufacture of Beverages (Group 110)**. Together, they span the spectrum from **food production and processing** to **retail consumption**, providing a comprehensive view of how food-related businesses emerge and evolve across the city. Examining their spatial and temporal patterns allows us to understand not only where F&B establishments are located, but also how they interact with upstream manufacturers and beverage producers. This holistic perspective offers valuable insights into the clustering of economic activities, the shaping of commercial districts, and the role of the F&B ecosystem in supporting urban development and community life.

Below is the details of the business type selected:

**56 – Food and Beverage Service Activities**

-   **Division 56**: Food and beverage service activities
    -   Includes: Restaurants, cafés, fast food outlets, food courts, coffee shops, hawker centers, caterers, pubs, bars, nightclubs, and other drinking places.

    -   Covers businesses primarily engaged in **preparing meals, snacks, and drinks for immediate consumption**.

**107 – Manufacture of Other Food Products**

-   **Division 10**: Manufacture of food products

-   **Group 107**: Manufacture of other food products

    -   Includes:

        -   **1071** – Manufacture of bakery products (bread, biscuits, cakes, confectionery)

        -   **1074** – Manufacture of macaroni, noodles, vermicelli and related products

        -   **1075** – Manufacture of prepared meals and dishes (e.g., frozen dinners)

        -   **1076** – Manufacture of coffee, tea and related products

        -   **1079** – Manufacture of other food products n.e.c. (sauces, soya products, spices, chips, crackers, titbits)

**110 – Manufacture of Beverages**

-   **Division 11**: Manufacture of beverages

-   **Group 110**: Manufacture of beverages

    -   Includes:

        -   **1101** – Distilling, rectifying and blending of spirits

        -   **1102** – Manufacture of wines

        -   **1103** – Manufacture of malt liquors and malt (beer, stout)

        -   **1104** – Manufacture of soft drinks, bottled/mineral waters, cordials, syrups, composite concentrates, and ice.

### 2.2.2 Datasets

| **Dataset Name** | **Description** | **Format** | **Source** |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| ACRA (Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority) Information on Corporate Entities | Datasets of registered entities in Singapore. (We will select business entities registered between 1st January 2024 to 30th June 2025.) | CSV | [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/collections/2/view) |
| SSIC: Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) | Official system for classifying economic activity of business establishments in Singapore. | XLSX | [SSIC](https://classification.codes/classifications/industry/ssic-singapore) |
| Singapore Master Plan 2019 (URA) Zoning Data | Singapore's land-use zones: residential, commercial, mixed-use, industrial. | GEOJSON | [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_8594ae9ff96d0c708bc2af633048edfb/view) |
| LTA MRT Station Exit | Geospatial data for Singapore’s MRT/LRT stations exit. | GEOJSON | [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_b39d3a0871985372d7e1637193335da5/view) |

## **2.3 Data Importing & Wrangling**

### **2.3.1 Importing ACRA data**

The ACRA Corporate Entities CSV files were imported into R using [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/). The first 24 columns were retained, covering entity identifiers, names, incorporation dates, SSIC codes, and addresses. This ensured consistency across all files as we are dropping the unnecessary fields such as fields with excessive missing values or fields with only single values.

```{r}
folder_path <- "data/aspatial/ACRA"
file_list <- list.files(path = folder_path,
                        pattern = "^ACRA*.*\\.csv$",
                        full.names = TRUE)

acra_data <- file_list %>%
  map_dfr(read_csv)
```

```{r}
glimpse(acra_data)
```

The dataset consists of 2,026,935 rows and 53 columns.

```{r}
write_rds(acra_data,
          "data/rds/acra_data.rds")
```

### **2.3.2 Tidying ACRA data**

**Standardisation of Key Fields**\
Column names were renamed to a common schema (`date`, `ssic_raw`, `postal_code`). Dates were converted into proper R `Date` objects. SSIC codes were cleaned to numeric strings, and **2-digit** (`ssic_2d`) and **3-digit** (`ssic_3d`) prefixes were extracted. Postal codes were also padded to six digits for consistency.

**Temporal Filtering**\
Only businesses registered between **01-Jan-2024 and 30-Jun-2025** were retained, aligning with the study’s spatio-temporal scope. Records with missing or invalid dates were excluded.

**Business Type Selection**\
The dataset was filtered to include only the **Food and Beverage / Hospitality categories**: **Division 56** – Food & Beverage Service Activities, **Group 107** – Manufacture of Other Food Products, **Group 110** – Manufacture of Beverages

```{r}
date_min <- as_date("2024-01-01")
date_max <- as_date("2025-06-30")
```

```{r}
acra_all_fnb <- acra_data %>%
  # keep the first 24 cols 
  select(1:24) %>%
  # commonize column names 
  rename(
    date        = registration_incorporation_date,
    ssic_raw    = primary_ssic_code,
    postal_code = postal_code
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    # dates
    date = as_date(date),
    # SSIC as character 
    ssic_raw = as.character(ssic_raw),
    ssic_raw = str_replace_all(ssic_raw, "[^0-9]", ""),   
    ssic_2d  = str_sub(ssic_raw, 1, 2),
    ssic_3d  = str_sub(ssic_raw, 1, 3),
    # clean postal code to 6-digit with zeros
    postal_code = str_pad(postal_code, width = 6, side = "left", pad = "0")
  ) %>%
  
  filter(!is.na(date), date >= date_min, date <= date_max) %>%
  # target Division 56 OR Group 107 OR Group 110
  filter(ssic_2d == "56" | ssic_3d %in% c("107", "110")) %>%
  # time fields
  mutate(
    YEAR       = year(date),
    MONTH_NUM  = month(date),
    MONTH_ABBR = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE),
    fnb_bucket = case_when(
      ssic_2d == "56"          ~ "F&B Services (Div 56)",
      ssic_3d == "107"         ~ "Food Manufacturing (Grp 107)",
      ssic_3d == "110"         ~ "Beverage Manufacturing (Grp 110)",
      TRUE                     ~ "Other"
    )
  )
```

**Sanity Checks & Subsets**\
Basic counts by `fnb_bucket` were generated to confirm category distribution. Monthly registration summaries were produced to validate temporal coverage. Separate data frames (`biz_56`, `biz_107`, `biz_110`) were created for more detailed subgroup analysis.

```{r}
# Counts by bucket
acra_all_fnb %>% count(fnb_bucket, sort = TRUE)

# Monthly registrations for later plotting
acra_all_fnb %>%
  count(YYYYMM = floor_date(date, "month"), fnb_bucket) %>%
  arrange(YYYYMM, fnb_bucket)
```

```{r}
# separate data frames for each bucket
biz_56  <- acra_all_fnb %>% filter(ssic_2d == "56")
biz_107 <- acra_all_fnb %>% filter(ssic_3d == "107")
biz_110 <- acra_all_fnb %>% filter(ssic_3d == "110")
```

```{r}
# Date column named `date` and a month column for plotting later:
acra_all_fnb <- acra_all_fnb %>%
  mutate(
    date  = as.Date(date),
    month = floor_date(date, "month"),
    postal_code = stringr::str_pad(postal_code, 6, pad = "0")
  )

biz_56  <- biz_56  %>% mutate(postal_code = stringr::str_pad(postal_code, 6, pad = "0"))
biz_107 <- biz_107 %>% mutate(postal_code = stringr::str_pad(postal_code, 6, pad = "0"))
biz_110 <- biz_110 %>% mutate(postal_code = stringr::str_pad(postal_code, 6, pad = "0"))
```

### 2.3.3 Geocoding

**Extract Unique Postcodes**\
Unique six-digit postal codes were extracted from the ACRA dataset. To ensure consistency, codes were padded with leading zeros where necessary and invalid entries (missing or non-numeric) were excluded.

**Query the OneMap API**\
Each postcode was sent to the OneMap Singapore API using the code chunk below. The API returned address details and coordinates (`X`, `Y` in SVY21 projection; `LATITUDE`, `LONGITUDE` in WGS84). Postcodes with no matches were logged separately for later review.

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

rds_found     <- "data/rds/geocode_found.rds"
rds_not_found <- "data/rds/geocode_not_found.rds"

if (file.exists(rds_found) && file.exists(rds_not_found)) {
  found     <- readRDS(rds_found)
  not_found <- readRDS(rds_not_found)
} else {
postcodes <- unique(acra_all_fnb$postal_code)

url <- "https://onemap.gov.sg/api/common/elastic/search"

found <- data.frame()
not_found <- data.frame(postcode = character())

for (pc in postcodes) {
  query <- list(
    searchVal = pc,
    returnGeom = "Y",
    getAddrDetails = "Y",
    pageNum = "1"
  )
  
  res <- GET(url, query = query)
  json <- content(res)
  
  if(json$found != 0) {
    df <- as.data.frame(json$results, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    df$input_postcode <- pc
    found <- bind_rows(found, df)
  } else {
    not_found <- bind_rows(not_found, data.frame(postcode = pc))
  }

}

dir.create("data", showWarnings = FALSE)
  saveRDS(found, rds_found)
  saveRDS(not_found, rds_not_found)
}
```

**Append Geocoding Results**\
Geocoding was performed by extracting unique six-digit postal codes from the ACRA dataset and submitting them to the OneMap Singapore API. The API returned both address details and geographic coordinates, which were then joined back to the business records. Invalid or missing coordinates were cleaned, and duplicates were removed to ensure data quality. The final datasets were converted into spatial features (`sf` objects) in the SVY21 projection (EPSG:3414), enabling integration with planning boundaries and spatial analysis. To ensure reproducibility and avoid repeated API calls, the geocoded datasets and unresolved cases were saved as `.rds` files.

```{r}
found <- found %>%
  #X/Y from OneMap are SVY21 (EPSG:3414); coerce to numeric
  mutate(
    X = suppressWarnings(as.numeric(X)),
    Y = suppressWarnings(as.numeric(Y))
  ) %>%
  # keep the essential columns
  select(1:10)
```

```{r}
acra_all_fnb <- acra_all_fnb %>% left_join(found, by = c("postal_code" = "POSTAL"))
biz_56       <- biz_56       %>% left_join(found, by = c("postal_code" = "POSTAL"))
biz_107      <- biz_107      %>% left_join(found, by = c("postal_code" = "POSTAL"))
biz_110      <- biz_110      %>% left_join(found, by = c("postal_code" = "POSTAL"))
```

```{r}
df_to_sf <- function(df, id_col = NULL) {
  df2 <- df %>%
    mutate(across(any_of(c("X","Y","LONGITUDE","LATITUDE")),
                  ~ suppressWarnings(as.numeric(.x))))

  if (all(c("X","Y") %in% names(df2))) {
    df2 <- df2 %>% filter(!is.na(X), !is.na(Y))
    if (!is.null(id_col) && id_col %in% names(df2)) {
      df2 <- df2 %>% group_by(.data[[id_col]]) %>% slice(1) %>% ungroup()
    }
    st_as_sf(df2, coords = c("X","Y"), crs = 3414)   
  } else if (all(c("LONGITUDE","LATITUDE") %in% names(df2))) {
    df2 <- df2 %>% filter(!is.na(LONGITUDE), !is.na(LATITUDE))
    if (!is.null(id_col) && id_col %in% names(df2)) {
      df2 <- df2 %>% group_by(.data[[id_col]]) %>% slice(1) %>% ungroup()
    }
    st_as_sf(df2, coords = c("LONGITUDE","LATITUDE"), crs = 4326)  
  } else {
    stop("No coordinate columns found. Expected X/Y or LONGITUDE/LATITUDE. Present: ",
         paste(names(df2), collapse = ", "))
  }
}

acra_all_fnb_sf <- df_to_sf(acra_all_fnb, id_col = "uen")
biz_56_sf       <- df_to_sf(biz_56,       id_col = "uen")
biz_107_sf      <- df_to_sf(biz_107,      id_col = "uen")
biz_110_sf      <- df_to_sf(biz_110,      id_col = "uen")
```

```{r}
write_rds(acra_all_fnb, "data/rds/acra_all_fnb.rds")
write_rds(biz_56,       "data/rds/biz_56.rds")
write_rds(biz_107,      "data/rds/biz_107.rds")
write_rds(biz_110,      "data/rds/biz_110.rds")
write_rds(not_found,    "data/rds/postcodes_not_found.rds") 
```

```{r}
biz_missing <- acra_all_fnb %>%
  mutate(X = suppressWarnings(as.numeric(X)), Y = suppressWarnings(as.numeric(Y))) %>%
  filter(is.na(X) | is.na(Y))
write_rds(biz_missing, "data/rds/biz_missing_coords.rds")
```

# **3 Exploratory Observation**

Before conducting the Spatial Point Pattern Analysis, we will first perform visualizing to better understand the underlying patterns and distributions in the data.

We will import the Singapore Master Plan 2019 (URA) Zoning Data:

```{r}
# Load URA Subzone boundaries
subzones <- st_read("data/geospatial/MasterPlan2019SubzoneBoundaryNoSeaGEOJSON.geojson") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)

# Spatial join: assign each business to a subzone
acra_all_fnb_sf <- st_join(acra_all_fnb_sf, subzones)
```

Visualize the businesses on map:

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")  # interactive map
tm_shape(subzones) + tm_borders() +
tm_shape(acra_all_fnb_sf) + tm_dots(col = "fnb_bucket", size = 0.05)
```

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
```

Reveal the distribution of newly registered businesses by month:

```{r}
monthly_counts <- acra_all_fnb %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date), month = floor_date(date, "month")) %>%
  count(month)

ggplot(monthly_counts, aes(x = month, y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b-%Y", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  labs(x = "Month of Registration", y = "Number of Businesses",
       title = "Monthly New F&B/Hospitality Registrations (Jan 2024 – Jun 2025)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

::: {.callout-note icon="true" title="Observation"}
-   **Monthly Trends**: Registrations remained fairly steady at \~350–420 businesses per month. Noticeable declines occurred in Feb 2024 and Dec 2024, likely due to holiday or festive effects.
-   **Rebounds:** Peaks in Aug 2024 and Mar 2025 suggest post-holiday rebounds.
-   **Spatial Clustering:** Businesses are densely concentrated in central and eastern regions (Downtown, Geylang, Bedok, Tampines). Western catchment, Lim Chu Kang, and offshore islands show minimal registrations.
-   **Category Mix:** Service-oriented F&B dominate urban areas, while manufacturing clusters are more peripheral.

# **4 Spatial Point Pattern Analysis**

## **4.1 First-order spatial point pattern analysis**

### **4.1.1 Computing kernel density estimation** 

We will compute the kernel density estimate (KDE) for each business types using `bw.ppl`:

```{r}
sg_bound <- subzones %>% 
  st_make_valid() %>% 
  st_union() %>% 
  st_cast("MULTIPOLYGON") %>%
  st_transform(3414)   

sg_owin <- as.owin(sg_bound)   
```

```{r}
to_ppp <- function(sf_points, window_W) {
  sf_points <- st_transform(sf_points, 3414)
  coords <- st_coordinates(sf_points)
  ppp(x = coords[,1], y = coords[,2], window = window_W, checkdup = FALSE)
}

ppp_all  <- to_ppp(acra_all_fnb_sf, sg_owin)
ppp_56   <- to_ppp(biz_56_sf, sg_owin)
ppp_107  <- to_ppp(biz_107_sf, sg_owin)
ppp_110  <- to_ppp(biz_110_sf, sg_owin)
```

```{r}
ppp_all_km <- rescale.ppp(ppp_all, 1000, "km")

bw_all_ppl <- density(ppp_all_km,
                          sigma=bw.ppl, 
                          edge=TRUE,
                          kernel="gaussian")

plot(bw_all_ppl, main = "Intensity (KDE) — All F&B")
```

```{r}
ppp_56_km <- rescale.ppp(ppp_56, 1000, "km")
ppp_107_km <- rescale.ppp(ppp_107, 1000, "km")
ppp_110_km <- rescale.ppp(ppp_110, 1000, "km")

bw_56_ppl <- density(ppp_56_km,
                          sigma=bw.ppl, 
                          edge=TRUE,
                          kernel="gaussian")
bw_107_ppl <- density(ppp_107_km,
                          sigma=bw.ppl, 
                          edge=TRUE,
                          kernel="gaussian")
bw_110_ppl <- density(ppp_110_km,
                          sigma=bw.ppl, 
                          edge=TRUE,
                          kernel="gaussian")

par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(bw_56_ppl, main = "Div 56")
plot(bw_107_ppl, main = "Grp 107")
plot(bw_110_ppl, main = "Grp 110")
```

### **4.1.2 Clark-Evan Test for Nearest Neighbour Analysis**

We will perform the Clark-Evans test of aggregation for a spatial point pattern using the `clarkevans.test()` function from the **`spatstat`** package.

The test hypotheses are:

Ho = The distribution of F&B businesses are randomly distributed.

H1= The distribution of F&B businesses are not randomly distributed.

The 95% confident interval will be used.

```{r}
clarkevans.test(ppp_all,
                correction="none",
                clipregion="sg_owin",
                alternative=c("clustered"),
                method="MonteCarlo",
                nsim=39)
```

**Conclusion**: **Reject H₀**. The distribution of F&B businesses is **statistically significantly clustered, not random**. This clustering is likely tied to underlying factors such as high population density in urban areas or specific government's planning.
